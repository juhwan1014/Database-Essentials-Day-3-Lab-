    * In the last 2 Sections add 1 Row
    * 25 Seats in each Row of Sections 1-15
    * 10 Seats in each Row of Sections 16-18

4. Add EventSeatSale records for the sales of the first 75 test customers
    * If they are Test1 - Test24 give them 2 seats in SEC 1 in the Row matching their number and the first seat matching their number. ex: Test1 would get SEC1-Row 1-Seat 1 & 2, Test 24 would get SEC1-Row 24-Seat 24 & 25
    * Test25 - Test49 can each be given 1 Seat in SEC1 Row 25 (this should fill the row)
